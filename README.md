# Hyperparameter-is-all-you-need
the implementation of the paper 'Hyperparameter is all you need: your diffusion model can sample an image within 5 steps without additional training.'
run the customed_timeschedule_sampler.py, customed_timeschedule_sampler_xl.py, customed_timeschedule_sampler_laion.py, customed_timeschedule_sampler_xl_laion.py to get the experiment result.  This project use diffusers, which means you can simply install the environment by using pip install withoug confronting any conflict.  The requirement of the environment is in environment.yml.  In this project, we also provide a upgrade implementation, which ultilize the golden noise to generate the images.

To run the code properly, you should also download coco 2014 and coco 2017 dataset from https://cocodataset.org/#home
