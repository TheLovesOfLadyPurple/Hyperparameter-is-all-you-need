# Hyperparameters-are-all-you-need
the implementation of the paper 'Hyperparameters are all you need: Using five-step inference for an original diffusion model to generate images comparable to the latest distillation model.'
run the customed_timeschedule_sampler.py, customed_timeschedule_sampler_xl.py, customed_timeschedule_sampler_laion.py, customed_timeschedule_sampler_xl_laion.py to get the experiment result.  This project use diffusers, which means you can simply install the environment by using pip install withoug confronting any conflict.  The requirement of the environment is in environment.yml.  In this project, we also provide a upgrade implementation, which ultilize the golden noise to generate the images.

To run the code properly, you should also download coco 2014 and coco 2017 dataset from https://cocodataset.org/#home
